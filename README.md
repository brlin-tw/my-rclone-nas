# My NAS accessibility utilities based on rclone

I am using WebDAV to access my files on my home NAS, however the UX while doing so on some desktop environment I'm using(e.g. KDE(cough, cough...)) isn't exactly great.

I recently found out mounting the WebDAV filesytem using the rclone utility to be exceptionally useful to workaround this problem, this project develops related tools to facilitate that goal.
